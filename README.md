## Collaborative versus content
The purpose of a recommender system is to suggest relevant items to users. To achieve this task, there exist two major categories of methods : collaborative filtering methods and content based methods. Before digging more into details of particular algorithms, let’s discuss briefly these two main paradigms.

### Collaborative filtering methods
Collaborative methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations. These interactions are stored in the so-called “user-item interactions matrix”.

Then, the main idea that rules collaborative methods is that these past user-item interactions are sufficient to detect similar users and/or similar items and make predictions based on these estimated proximities.

The class of collaborative filtering algorithms is divided into two sub-categories that are generally called memory based and model based approaches. Memory based approaches directly works with values of recorded interactions, assuming no model, and are essentially based on nearest neighbours search (for example, find the closest users from a user of interest and suggest the most popular items among these neighbours). Model based approaches assume an underlying “generative” model that explains the user-item interactions and try to discover it in order to make new predictions.

Overview of the collaborative filtering methods paradigm.
The main advantage of collaborative approaches is that they require no information about users or items and, so, they can be used in many situations. Moreover, the more users interact with items the more new recommendations become accurate: for a fixed set of users and items, new interactions recorded over time bring new information and make the system more and more effective.

However, as it only consider past interactions to make recommendations, collaborative filtering suffer from the “cold start problem”: it is impossible to recommend anything to new users or to recommend a new item to any users and many users or items have too few interactions to be efficiently handled. This drawback can be addressed in different way: recommending random items to new users or new items to random users (random strategy), recommending popular items to new users or new items to most active users (maximum expectation strategy), recommending a set of various items to new users or a new item to a set of various users (exploratory strategy) or, finally, using a non collaborative method for the early life of the user or the item.

In the following sections, we will mainly present three classical collaborative filtering approaches: two memory based methods (user-user and item-item) and one model based approach (matrix factorisation).

### Content based methods
Unlike collaborative methods that only rely on the user-item interactions, content based approaches use additional information about users and/or items. If we consider the example of a movies recommender system, this additional information can be, for example, the age, the sex, the job or any other personal information for users as well as the category, the main actors, the duration or other characteristics for the movies (items).

Then, the idea of content based methods is to try to build a model, based on the available “features”, that explain the observed user-item interactions. Still considering users and movies, we will try, for example, to model the fact that young women tend to rate better some movies, that young men tend to rate better some other movies and so on. If we manage to get such model, then, making new predictions for a user is pretty easy: we just need to look at the profile (age, sex, …) of this user and, based on this information, to determine relevant movies to suggest.

Overview of the content based methods paradigm.

<span style="color:blue">Content based methods suffer far less from the cold start problem than collaborative approaches: new users or items can be described by their characteristics (content) and so relevant suggestions can be done for these new entities.</span> Only new users or items with previously unseen features will logically suffer from this drawback, but once the system old enough, this has few to no chance to happen.

Later in this post, we will further discuss content based approaches and see that, depending on our problem, various classification or regression models can be used, ranging from very simple to much more complex models.

### Models, bias and variance
Let’s focus a bit more on the main differences between the previously mentioned methods. More especially let’s see the implication that the modelling level has on the bias and the variance.

In memory based collaborative methods, no latent model is assumed. The algorithms directly works with the user-item interactions: for example, users are represented by their interactions with items and a nearest neighbours search on these representations is used to produce suggestions. As no latent model is assumed, these methods have theoretically a low bias but a high variance.

In model based collaborative methods, some latent interaction model is assumed. The model is trained to reconstruct user-item interactions values from its own representation of users and items. New suggestions can then be done based on this model. The users and items latent representations extracted by the model have a mathematical meaning that can be hard to interpret for a human being. As a (pretty free) model for user-item interactions is assumed, this methods has theoretically a higher bias but a lower variance than methods assuming no latent model.

Finally, in content based methods some latent interaction model is also assumed. However, here, the model is provided with content that define the representation of users and/or items: for example, users are represented by given features and we try to model for each item the kind of user profile that likes or not this item. Here, as for model based collaborative methods, a user-item interactions model is assumed. However, this model is more constrained (because representation of users and/or items are given) and, so, the method tends to have the highest bias but the lowest variance.
